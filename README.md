I am learning git commands through this lab.

## Why these patterns matter
- bin/: Keeps extra program files out of Git.
- Thumbs.db: skips Windows image preview files that aren't part of the project.

## Branches
- author/idea-sprint: this branch is used to write and test with new content ideas.
- editor/review: this branch is used to review and edit the author's work before merging.
